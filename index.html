      Hello there! I'm a BS/MS student in computer science at UCSD graduating in June '25, interested broadly in networking, operating systems, and ML systems.
      I supported Windows driver development for cellular modems at <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/snapdragon/products/5g-modems">Qualcomm</a>
      and worked on security-oriented web services at <a href="https://pki-center.com/">CommScope</a>. Before that, I worked on 
      <a href="https://catalog.caida.org">catalog.caida.org</a> and other software for Internet measurement research at <a href="https://caida.org">CAIDA</a>.
      I also tutored a few times for a statistics course (CSE 103).
    </p>      
    <p>
      I will be joining Meta in July as a Production Engineer in Menlo Park, CA.
