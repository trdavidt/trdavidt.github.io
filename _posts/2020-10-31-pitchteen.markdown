[Pitchteen website](https://anjalichaturvedi.github.io/pitchteen/)

Upcoming pitch competition site for high school students. Static site, single-page layout. Implemented distinguishable sections for competition info, organization info, work in progress. Basic animations (fade-in, typing) from scratch. Future updates may include some backend work.
